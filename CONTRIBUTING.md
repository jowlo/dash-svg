# CONTRIBUTING

This project was generated by the [dash-component-boilerplate](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate) it contains the minimal set of code required to create your own custom Dash component.

### Building the component library

    npm install
    pip install -r requirements.txt

As with the Plotly/Dash [dash_html_components] library the SVG library components
are created automatically by scraping [SVG@developer.mozilla.org]. The *./scripts*
folder contains the scripts that are used to scrape and create the SVG
component source. This step is only required if you need to
regenerate the source.

    cd ./scripts
    ./generate-all.sh
    cd ..

The generated react component source files are in *./src/lib/components*. To build the
components:

    npm run build

#### Create tarball

First change the release version in [package.json](package.json), then:

    rm -rf dist/*
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

The tarball is in *dist/dash_svg-<version>.tar.gz*

If need, you can copy and install the tarball directly in a dash project:

    pip install dash_svg-<version>.tar.gz

#### Publish

To upload the package to pypi.

    twine upload dist/*

Or to alternate repo

    twine upload -r pypicloud dist/*
